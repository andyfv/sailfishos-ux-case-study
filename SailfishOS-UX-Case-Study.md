# UX Case Study: Sailfish OS

As with most case studies the idea is to explore the current state of a particular area and make some propositions about impoving it.

So without much babble let's get starting.

***

First, let's talk context. We have to deal with multiple contexts. So let's find the borders/limitations we have to work with.

#### 1. Hardware Limitations

Now let's start with what know. **`Jolla`** are not making hardware anymore so they don't have much control here. Taking this is concideration and moving on with the currently supported devices.


>>>
**Mobile Phones**: 
- Jolla (4.5 inch, 16:9 ratio)
- Jolla C (5.0 inch, 16:9 ratio)
- Sony Xperia X (5.0 inch, 16:9 ratio)
- Sony XA2 (5.2 inch, 16:9 ratio)
- Sony XA2 Ultra (6.0 inch, 16:9 ratio)
- Sony XA2 Plus (6.0 inch, 18:9 ratio)

**Tablets**: 
- Jolla Tablet (7.85inch, 4:3 ratio)

In the context of hardware the differences are mostly dimensional. Sadly, different and more inovative types of hardware for interacting with the devices are hard to find. So letâ€™s focus just on the screen dimensions for now.

Based on the screen sizes we can limit the scope a bit.
Phone makers are probably going to stay with the current trend of bigger screens for some time. (Possibly the upcomming folding phones will disrupt this trend)

Knowing this, the research will be concentrated on the control of the devices  based on the screen sizes.
